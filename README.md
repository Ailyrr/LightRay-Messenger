**LightRay Messenger**
*Highschool Project*

This is the final stable build of the Light Ray messenger as of August 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Description**
This project was build from the ground up using PHP *GET* and *POST* methods. Even though this makes
the website pretty slow, especially when a lot of traffic is infliced on it, it made the building
process easier to understand and build. As this was my first time using PHP and Javascript AJAX methods.

**Functions**
When a user creates an account he will have the abilty to message each user present on the website.
The user is also able to edit their; *username, email, profile picture, description, links, description*

An update to add a friend list is currently not planned. A V2 of the website will, if it ever happens,
for sure have one.

Thank you for looking at my project
